# k0rx-interface-pcb
A PCB implementation of an audio data mode interface designed by K0RX, David Andersen

Original circuit here: https://k0rx.com/blog/2017/11/baofeng.html

I made this up into a small 4x4cm PCB to replace a horrible stripboard prototype. I'm releasing the Gerber files and the KiCad project in case anyone wants to have a play. The project has now been upgraded to be compatible with KiCad V6.

There are more complex interfaces available to make or buy but I loved the simplicity of David's design. A small enclosure could be made for the box, and I've included an example of this in FreeCAD format also.

I had to change some resistors in my implementation as David mentions, and I totally missed out the potentiometer, opting for a single 2k2 resistor. I also added a hard switch for toggling Tx/Rx as well as the optocoupler. I am only using a single audio channel as David does, so you can either leave the other one hanging or send to ground I guess. The 82k resistor may need some adjustment, see what level works for you (breadboard it and test, perhaps).

An improvement you may want to add is a proper connector for the radio cable rather than cutting the end off a cable and soldering it directly. Especially if mounting it in a box.

This interface works great for me for SSTV & APRS work and for general audio recording from the radio. The total cost of all of the parts (including PCB fabbing from
JLCPCB) is around Â£15, the most expensive parts being the cables.
